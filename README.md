This repository contains the python code for 3-question based a technicat test.

The file named 'test.py' is specially used to run the test related to compre LEXICOGRAPHICALLY two input strings.

The 'test_for_lru_cache.py' can be used to instantiate the LRUCache object in order to test the proposed program. To solve efficiently this LRUCache problem, we took advantage of the strength of TWO types of DATA STRUCTURES namelly DOUBLE LINKED LIST AND DICTIONARY. This allowe us to vae consistent time complexity.
