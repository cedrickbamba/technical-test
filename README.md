This repository contains python code for 3-questions based technical test.

The file named 'test.py' is specially used to run the test related to compare LEXICOGRAPHICALLY two input strings.

The 'test_for_lru_cache.py' file in turn can be used to instantiate the LRUCache object in order to test the proposed program. To solve efficiently this LRUCache problem, we took advantage of the strength of TWO types of DATA STRUCTURES namelly DOUBLE LINKED LIST AND DICTIONARY. This allowed us to have consistent time complexity.
